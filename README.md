## Deployment

If you want to run this bot yourself, follow the instructions on Discord's developer page [here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) to create an application.

-- create .env file, enter discord api key

-- (ideally) your own key for AirLabs (I'm on the free plan that gives you ~1000 requests per month and I've probably used most of them up in testing!)

-- yeah who's doing this anyway lmao
